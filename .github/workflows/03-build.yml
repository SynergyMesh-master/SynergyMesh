name: Governed Build Pipeline
# Consolidated workflows: lint/test/build across Node/Rust/Go/Python/Java and governance validation
# Removed optional workflows: docker image builds (use release workflow), deployment/CD pipelines, SARIF security uploads
# Behavior: single governed job runs sequentially to preserve ordering and reduce runner concurrency cost; adjust to matrix if speed outweighs ordering needs
